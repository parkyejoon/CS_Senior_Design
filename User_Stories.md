As a **parent of a child**, I want **to make my child learns a basic mechanism of programming with having fun**, so that **the child can learn the concept while playing the game**.

As a **young student who will study a coding later**, I want **to understand the concept while playing the game**, so that **I can study easily real programming language such as python later**.
