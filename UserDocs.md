  - **user manual**
    - This project is devloping a puzzle game. After playing the game, user will understand what is algorithm and how programming works. It will not teach a specific computer language or programming detailedly, but user can learn a basic concept of programming and algorithm. In the game, user will make an simple algorithm to solve a game stage by connecting block that has an specific command such as 'go striaght' or 'turn right'. For example, if user wants to move the car, user can make an algorithm by 'go straight' block. Also, user can add other blocks to add some more commands. To complete the game stage, user needs to make an algorithm, and moves the car to arrive at goal position. If car conflicted to the wall, or car could not arrived at goal position after running the algorithm, user needs to try with other algorithm to complete the stage.
